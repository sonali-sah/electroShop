Not all the time but often enough to be disruptive. We have both used it over the past seven months and can genuinely say we have felt the benefit. If we persist and use it each day for a session morning and night, the pain diminishes enormously and stays away for quite a while. It does not claim to be a total solution to pain problems, but it really has helped. We think it is well worth a try",

Only slightly negative is that I do need to use two on my back as I thought the unit was larger, but that's probably my fault for not reading the specs on the unit. Single unit is great for my knees and shoulder. Overall, I am really happy with these",
